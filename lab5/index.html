			<p>We have created a 4 pages document, which treated the subject of the Web Pirates.</p>

			<p>My principales difficulties were to not get lost by the many differents CSS and HTML pages, and to be sure that everything was working.<br>
				I also had some troubles with uploading the images because I put .jpg instead of .png.
				<br>I took a lot of time to figure out what were all the meaning of the differents properties.</p>

				 <p>I finally arrived to finish the Website, but mine was very ugly comparing to some of my classmates.
				 I also had a few errors left; in the future, I want to work on my presentation and be better in the choice of colours.</p>
